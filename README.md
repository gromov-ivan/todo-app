## ToDo app

- An Express backend that handles ToDo tasks stored in an array via a REST API endpoint.
- A React frontend with a ToDo app where initial tasks are fetched from the backend.
- CI/CD pipeline for integrating and deploying the application.



The database was implemented using MongoDB and Docker. It can store, save and upload todo tasks. However, it only works on the university server using a VPN. GitLab was used as a CI/CD tool and the file is kept for demonstration purposes.
